# Voice-activated-AI-assistant
The Voice-Activated AI Assistant is a Python-based intelligent system that interacts with users through voice commands, using advanced natural language processing and speech synthesis techniques. It integrates several Python libraries to create a versatile and interactive AI tool capable of performing various tasks on the system and the web.

Key Libraries Integrated: speech_recognition: This library allows the AI assistant to capture and recognize speech input, converting it into text for further processing.
pyttsx3: A text-to-speech conversion tool that provides the assistant the ability to speak back to the user, creating a more interactive experience.
google.generativeai: Enables the assistant to harness the power of generative AI, allowing it to engage in intelligent conversations and provide dynamic responses to complex queries.
os: This library enables system-level operations like opening files, executing shell commands, or interacting with the operating system.
webbrowser: The assistant can open web browsers to search for information, access websites, or perform online tasks via simple voice commands.
subprocess: Used to manage and run system-level processes in the background, such as opening applications or running commands.
datetime: Provides the assistant with the ability to handle date and time-based tasks, including scheduling, setting reminders, or reporting current date/time.
Features: Speech Recognition: The AI listens to voice commands, decodes speech, and takes appropriate actions.
Text-to-Speech: Responds back to the user in a clear, human-like voice.
Generative AI Responses: Engages in conversational exchanges, providing helpful and detailed responses by integrating generative AI.
Web Access: Performs web searches or opens specific web pages on command.
System Interaction: Opens files, runs applications, and executes system commands like playing music, opening folders, or shutting down the system.
Time-Based Features: Provides real-time information and handles requests like setting alarms or checking the current date and time.
